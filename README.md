# Simon-Memory-Game
General information: Simon is a memory based game where you memorize a sequence a sequence and each time you remeber the correct sequence the longer it gets. This project was done in my COMPUTER ARCH & ASSEM LANGUAGE 271 at Oregon State University.

##How to play
You will be given the first sequence remember the sequence and input each number sequence individually when prompted. The sequence will get 1+ longer each time. The game will remind you how the sequence is from beginning to end each time when you get the sequence correct.

##Note
Do not enter all your sequences in one input. Wait until the program asks you to input the next sequence.

##How to Complie game
You will need to install the Irvine32.inc which can be found here http://kipirvine.com/asm/ Along with other files that are not included here. Once you have that install you will be able to compile this code.
