# Simon-Memory-Game
General information: Simon is a memory based game where you memorize a sequence a sequence and each time you remeber the correct sequence the longer it gets. This project was done in my COMPUTER ARCH & ASSEM LANGUAGE 271 at Oregon State University.

## How to play
You will be given the first sequence remember the sequence and input each number sequence individually when prompted. The sequence will get 1+ longer each time. The game will remind you how the sequence is from beginning to end each time when you get the sequence correct.

## Note
Do not enter all your sequences in one input. Wait until the program asks you to input the next sequence.

You will need to install the Irvine32.inc which can be found here http://kipirvine.com/asm/ Along with other files that are not included here. Once you have that install you will be able to compile this code.
